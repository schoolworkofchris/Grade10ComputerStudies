    <h1>GPU</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    OK, so we are finally finished with choosing our CPU and don’t worry, that’s one of 
    the hardest to choose just because of the fact that there are so many models across 
    two brands, but now its time to choose our graphics card, what is a graphics card? 
    Well, the graphics card is in charge of what you see on the screen, without it, you 
    won’t be able to see anything on your screen.

    <h3>Integrated Graphics</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Some CPU’s have integrated graphics and integrated graphics allows you to just use 
    the HDMI port in your motherboard without getting a GPU, but if you don’t have 
    integrated graphics in your CPU then nothing will happen as you don’t have a GPU. that 
    being said, even if you have integrated graphics, it’s still recommended that you get a 
    GPU if you plan on doing graphic intensive things on your PC such as gaming or video 
    editing, etc.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Discrete GPU’s</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Discrete GPU’s are just normal graphics cards rather than integrated graphics, there are 
    many different GPU’s for different use cases but here are some of the most popular and 
    powerful GPU’s but if you just need a GPU for the sake of your computer working and won’t 
    be doing anything graphics intensive then feel free to get something cheaper bur remembers 
    to do your research.

    need this much then you can save lots of money.
