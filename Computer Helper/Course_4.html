    <h1>Processor / CPU (The Brainz)</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    To start the journey through your PC build let’s start by picking one 
    of the most important parts of your PC and that would be the processor, 
    what is a processor? well you may know it better by the name “CPU”, and 
    the CPU is the brains of the computer, it is what gives the computer 
    functionality, it calculates what needs to be calculated and displays 
    the text as the text we all know and love rather than the 1’s and 0’s 
    that the processor knows.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="parText">
    There are two main processor manufacturers that all people use in their 
    computers and you may even have an older processor from one of the 
    manufacturers, these manufactures are AMD and Intel, at the moment AMD is 
    better but these stats always change so I recommend finding an up to date 
    article on which company is better first, but since AMD is better at the time 
    of me making this course, I will be referring to them more.
    </p>

    <p class="parText">
    But now that we know what two companies you should be buying from, let’s take 
    a look at the processor lineups from both of these companies.
