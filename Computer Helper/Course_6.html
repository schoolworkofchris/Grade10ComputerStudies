    <h1>Storage</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    So, now its time to probably make one of the easiest decisions, but, that doesn't 
    mean you shouldn't put at least a little thought into it, if you don't have enough storage, 
    you'll find yourself deleting stuff all day, if you have too much, well then that's not a 
    problem at all which is why I actually recommend getting 50-100 GB more than what you need 
    to future proof because apps, as well as the OS, is always getting larger so having extra 
    space is going to be very nice for the future.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <p class="parText">
    But, how much should you get? Well that question really depends on you, are you planning 
    on doing gaming, well you probably will want to start with 1TB but if you use lots of apps 
    or store a lot of large files then you will also need a lot but it really just depends on 
    you, here are some questions to help you choose. How much do you currently have? Is your 
    current storage enough for you? If you don't have enough storage, how much would be enough 
    to make you comfortable?
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="parText">
    Ok, so now you have a number but what storage device should you go with, well there are 
    three main types of storage, there are Hard Drives (HDD), there are solid-state drives 
    (SSD), and lastly, there is M.2.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h3>HDD</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    HDD is a short form for Hard Disk Drive, the Hard Drive is the slowest in this list as 
    it has been around for many years, but the hard drive is still great for PC’s today 
    however they will affect load time significantly, hard drives are also known for 
    breaking easier, especially if you drop it, so if you are getting a laptop then make 
    sure you don’t have a hard drive in it. I also don’t recommend a hard drive if you are 
    trying to make a fast PC as if you put a Hard Drive in it, even if you have really 
    powerful parts the hard drive is going to really affect performance.
    </p>

    <br>   

    <h3>SSD</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Next, we have the SSD, what does SSD stand for? SSD stands for Solid State Drive and 
    is a huge update over the standard Hard Drive, this is the part I recommend for anyone 
    who doesn’t need ultimate speed for things like gaming or professional video editing, 
    the SSD is very fast and also way more reliable than the SSD and can almost not be 
    broken by accident so if you need a PC then I really recommend the SSD as it is only 
    beaten by the M.2 SSD which you should also read about before choosing.
    </p>

    <br>   
    
    <h3>M.2</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Finally, on this list we have the M.2 SSD, why talk about it separately, well the M.2 
    SSD is significantly different from the normal SSD from size to form factor to where 
    it connects. First off let's talk about the form factor, M.2 SSD’s are one of the 
    smallest forms of storage devices for computers, they are also very fast which 
    means that they are going to need their own proprietary slot whereas the standard SSD 
    just uses the same SATA connection as the Hard Drive.  
    </p>

    <p class="parText">
    M.2 SSD’s also have multiple standards and these standards are just to represent speed and 
    if you want the fastest then you will want to get an m.2 SSD with the NVMe Standard as 
    those can get up to a couple of GB/s.
    </p>

    <br>   
    
    <h3>Choosing</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    When it comes to choosing the correct type here is a little guidance, I don't really 
    recommend a Hard Drive at all as the main storage device although you could use it as 
    a secondary device, the SSD is great for the average user, and I would recommend the 
    M.2 NVMe SSD if you need very fast speeds for things like vide3o editing or if you 
    do this that require writing large file a lot, I also recommend it for gaming as it 
    can give you the fastest load times and best performance although other parts such 
    as CPU and GPU also matter a lot.
