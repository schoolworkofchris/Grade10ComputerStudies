    <h1>Choosing</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    Now that you have some basic knowledge on CPU’s, its time to choose the best
    one for you, what I usually do to easily find the best one for me is figure 
    out the most intensive thing I would do on the computer, then go onto YoutTube 
    and search up “best processor for this task” and then watched some videos, for 
    me, I needed something to do some great video editing so I looked up “best 
    processors for video editing” and found that the Ryzen 5 3600 was the best as 
    it provided enough power to edit videos and also was very future-proofed.

    <p class="parText">
    So take some time right now and think of what you want to do on your computer 
    and figure out what the most intensive thing you will be doing.
