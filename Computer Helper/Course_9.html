    <h1>Power Supply</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    Finally, it’s time to get our power supply. What is the power supply? The power supply is in 
    charge of delivering power to every component of your computer and today I am going to help you 
    choose the power supply for you.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Wattage</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    When hunting for a power supply, you will notice that they all have a wattage written on it, 
    this number is very important, it is ok for the number to be higher then needed as it will just 
    automatically adjust itself to the right voltage needed, but if the number is too low then you 
    can't do anything about it, all you can do is get a different power supply which is why it is 
    very important to calculate the amount of power each part needs then get something that is around
     50 - 100 watts more then you needed just to be safe.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Types</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    There are also different types of power supplies, there are modular. Semi-modular and non-modular. 
    Below is and explanations of each.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Semi-modular</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    A semi-modular power supply is a power supply that has some cables that can get disconnected, only 
    the necessary cables are connected to it, this is very nice for cable management as you won’t be left 
    with a ton of unused cable around.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Modular</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    A modular power supply is almost like a semi-modular power supply but on a modular power supply, you 
    can disconnect every single cable from the power supply.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Non-modular</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    And last, we have the non-modular power supply, a non-modular power supply has all the cable hard 
    connected to it and cannot be taken off unless cut off, this is the most unorganized power supply as it 
    will leave you with a ton of extra cables that you will just have to shove away to the side in your 
    case.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    If you are looking for a power supply that will keep your PC organized go for the semi-modular or the 
    modular power supply and if you want to save some money and don’t care about organization then just go for 
    the non-modular power supply.
