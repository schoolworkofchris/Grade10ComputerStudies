    <h1>The Motherboard</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    We are finally done choosing the parts which are going to make your computer run but now we 
    have to make those components run which is why these next chapters are going to assist you 
    in choosing all the parts you need to make all the parts such as the CPU, GPU RAM, and storage 
    device run.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="parText">
    In this chapter we are going to be choosing the motherboard, the motherboard is where all 
    these parts connect to, there is a slot for each part but since a lot of parts are different we 
    are going to have to choose the motherboard that works with all of your parts.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>RAM</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Let's first talk about the RAM slot, the RAM slot is called a DIMM slot and the DIMM slots 
    are different between generations, the slots for DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 are all different 
    which is why you have to get a motherboard that supports your RAM type, luckily you are 
    probably going with DDR4 as it is the newest so most new motherboards use DDR4.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Storage</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Next, let’s talk about storage devices, if you are going with a normal HDD or SSD then you 
    will just be using SATA which almost any new motherboard has but if you plan on going the M.2 
    route then you will have to make sure your motherboard has an M.2 slot. Luckily there is only 
    one type of M.2 slot so all you have to do is make sure that your motherboard has one and that’s 
    it.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>GPU</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Now, you will have to make sure that that you have the right slot for your GPU, most new GPU’s use 
    PCIe x 16, the 16 just means that the slot has 16 lanes, and even if you don’t have the right slot, 
    some slots that have more lanes are cross-compatible with devices that use fewer lanes so just make 
    sure your slot is compatible with your GPU and you should be good to go, luckily most GPU’s use x 
    16 however so most motherboards have x 16 in them so unless you get something older you probably 
    won’t have to worry about it.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>CPU</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    And finally, the most important slot is the CPU slot and these are also the most fragmented, this is 
    a slot that you will have to worry about the most in looking for a motherboard as all the other slots 
    just are the newest on the market but since there are so many different CPU’s on the market you will 
    have to search with lost you CPU uses and you then need to check your motherboard has that slot but 
    also make sure it’s compatible as some motherboards have the slots but aren’t always compatible with 
    your CPU.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    After you found a motherboard that has everything you need then you should be good to go buy it.
