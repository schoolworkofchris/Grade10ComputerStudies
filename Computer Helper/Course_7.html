    <h1>RAM</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    Random Access Memory better known as RAM is in charge of sending info from your storage device 
    (HDD, SSD, M.2 SSD) to your CPU as the CPU does not have any memory so whether the info is 
    going to or from the CPU it’s going to the RAM first which is why it's important to have enough 
    RAM so that you don't have issues in performance when using your device because if you don't 
    have enough RAM your computer will have to wait to finish with the first part of info before 
    finishing with the rest. The standard amount of RAM for a gaming PC is 16GB but if you won't be 
    doing any gaming I still recommend you put at least 8GB of RAM in your computer so that you don't 
    have too much freezing as well as putting 8GB will future proof it for when windows will require 
    more RAM.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h3>Different Speeds</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    RAM also comes in different types there are first oof different Generations of RAM, there are 
    DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, but if you are using a recent CPU then you will need DDR4 RAM but 
    aside from different Generation there are also different speeds for RAM and theses are measured in 
    Mhz the higher the number the better and if you are building a gaming PC I would recommend at 
    least 2000 Mhz but 3200 Mhz is better but if you are not doing gaming there is not really a point 
    for that high of a frequency so I would just recommend around 2000Mhz if possible.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    So to conclude if you are a gamer or something in that league then I recommend 16GB DDR4 32Mhz 
    RAM and if you don’t need that much then I recommend 8GB DDR4 200Mhz RAM.
