    <h1>The Case!</h1>
    <p class="parText">
    Congratulations, you have finally reached the last part, the case, this is one of the most fun 
    parts to choose because you just have to look at a few things such as size and cooling but besides 
    that everything else is personal preference, but for the people who don’t know what they are doing, 
    I put a few pointers below when it comes to choosing you case.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Size</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    There are multiple sizes when it comes to PC cases and these sizes are based on the motherboard size, 
    you will want to get a case that fits your motherboard without looking ridiculous. There are three main 
    types of sizes, ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX and you will usually find which motherboard you have in 
    the specifications.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Cooling</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    Cooling is also a factor to look at as there is air cooling and liquid cooling, if you are a beginner 
    then you probably will want to go with air cooling but if you are more advanced, you should look into 
    liquid cooling as it is way more effective, some cases are made for just one type of cooling and some 
    support both so be sure to look into you cooling type for your case before you buy.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Preference</h3>

    <p class="parText">
    The last factor to consider is aesthetics, while it doesn’t provide you with anything useful, it is always 
    nice to consider getting a case that you like. Do you want RGB? Do you want something minimal? Do you want 
    something with a glass side? You should consider all these things as well as other things you would like.
